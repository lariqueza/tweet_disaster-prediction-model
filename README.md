# tweet_disaster-prediction-model
This machine learning model predicts the authencity of tweets that are about real disasters and which one's are fake.
I will be using AutoML which is automation technology to predict the tweets with the available datasets.
AutoML stands for 'automated machine learning', AutoML simplifies the traditional/conventional steps of training a model, which can prove complex and time consuming.
AutoML has been introduced for automating the process of building an entire machine learning pipeline with minimal human interaction.
Benefits of using AutoML:
considers and selects available multiple learning algorithms like the random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, SVMs etc...
performs data preprocessing steps like feature engineering, missing value imputation, and feature selection.
optimization or the hyperparameter tuning for all models.
decides or tries multiple ways to ensemble or stack the algorithms.

For this model, I will be using an AutoML framework called AutoGluon. This open-source toolkit developed by AWS helps in getting a strong predictive performance in machine learning and deep learning models on text, image and tabular data.
